## Features

- Realtime Formation Monitoring(BP,BC Pressures)
- Brake Mode Management
- Distributor Remote Control
- Custom themes using RGB Values
- Overlay display
- Ability to hide columns


## Requirements
 TSW launched with the -HTTPAPI option
 Python 3.8 if running the non exe version
 
## How to Use
1. Start either TSW or the Formation Viewer first
2. Load into a service or sit in the loco you plan to drive(if freeroaming)
3. Wait for the program to read the data and display it(time waited here depends on formation)
# NOTE: The UI will freeze during rebuilding, please be patient
# NOTE: The program has full support for German Rolling stock(besides MU's), the program should load any formation but full support isnt guaranteed because DTG loves making up new names for brake cylinders/brake mode switches
I do not have many UK/US routes so i cant do more unless someone offers to help me with testing

## Special thanks to OpenMinded for helping me with testing the program
